	\par{
		I am a Software Engineer with a strong focus on MLOps. My Master's thesis was an exploration of machine learning, particularly deep learning, for music recommendation. My primary goal is to build robust MLOps systems that enable the scalability, reliability, and optimal performance of production ML models, as well as accelerate the process of scientists getting their ideas into production. I am happiest working on music or gaming-related products.

			{Current}       {Amazon}{ML SDE II}
			{Jan 2022}      {
								Designed and built machine learning infrastructure for gaming related science endeavors at scale. Provided ad-hoc software support to scientists.
							}
							{Python, SQL, Redshift, SageMaker, Docker, Airflow, MLOps}
							{
								\begin{itemize}
									\item \textbf{\textsc{LTV Model:}} Deployed a model at scale to predict customer lifetime value on a monthly basis for millions of customers. Collaborated with data scientists to convert the model into a production-ready ML system using MLOps principles, and managed the pipeline using AWS services.
									\item \textbf{\textsc{IGDB Partnership:}} Initiated a partnership between Prime Gaming and the Internet Game Database (IGDB) team to share game metadata. Drove alignment with leadership to adopt the IGDB game ID as the primary game ID in the Prime Gaming catalog. By doing so, Prime Gaming gained a rich set of game metadata to join its catalog items to for improved analytics. Independently built the IGDB data ingestion pipeline.

			{May 2019}      {
								Designed, implemented, and deployed software components and features for the Prime Gaming website; identified and solved problems, improved teamâ€™s software and development/testing processes, gparticipated in hiring and mentoring, led cross-team projects (with a focus on analytics, telemetry, and experimentation). Advised on recommendation systems for Prime Gaming.
							}
							{Java, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, DynamoDB, Kinesis}
							{
								\begin{itemize}
									\item \textbf{\textsc{Fiber:}} Redesigned a legacy metrics reporting system and led a team of SDEs and DEs to complete the work. Achieved a 100\% reduction in development hours for customer event metric changes by using a semi-structured data model. This laid the groundwork for broader analytics efforts at Prime Gaming by solving architectural bottlenecks that had been stifling innovation.
